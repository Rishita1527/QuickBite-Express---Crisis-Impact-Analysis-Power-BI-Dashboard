# QuickBite-Express-Crisis-Impact-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
This repository contains my submission for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 18. The objective was to analyze the sudden business decline of QuickBite Express, a fast-growing online food delivery platform, and uncover where, why, and how the crisis unfolded using data-driven insights.

🔗 Live Dashboard

📍 Project Context

QuickBite Express experienced strong growth before the crisis — high order velocity, strong customer retention, and stable restaurant partnerships.
But during the crisis period, the platform saw sharp drops in orders, ratings, retention, and revenue across cities and restaurants, prompting a detailed analysis to uncover root causes.

🎯 Business Goals

The management wanted clarity on:

What changed during the crisis across cities, restaurants, customers, and delivery operations

Which segments were hit hardest and why

Whether the decline was temporary or structural

What decisions would help recover trust and business
